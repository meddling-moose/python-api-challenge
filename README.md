# python-api-challenge

This challenge geared around querying api's to find weather information and then use geoapify to find hotel and location information using the weather to sort cities. Practically speaking, I sought to find good vacation locations based on weather.

At times I struggled with the api calls because I didn't key in on 400 responses quickly. Sometimes I would go on a bit of a wild goose chase to figure out what was wrong when in reality, I wasn't getting a successful response from the endpoint itself.

I pushed myself to create some sort of method to run my regressions and while I didn't capture all of the information in the method (specifically missing the equation text due to differences in chart size) I was still proud of the automation. I also tried to use masks in both parts of the assignment to filter my dfs.

Lastly a note about where I got the code from. The work is mine, but I used the starter code given by my class to start. This basically included comments and basic code to help structure the more challenging sections.
